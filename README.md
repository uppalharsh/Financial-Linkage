# Customer Financial Linkage

The main objective of this project is to understand how to utilize the financial linkage data model and measure the extent of customer experience (CX) influence on critical business results across different data sets.

Customer Financial linkage is a method of recognizing and comprehending the connections among various financial data sources to derive insights into business performance and uncover areas for enhancement. It includes linking data points that may appear unrelated to uncover trends and associations that could be overlooked when analyzed separately. The process involves analyzing how customer feedback (e.g., satisfaction scores, loyalty programs) relates to financial outcomes like sales, customer lifetime value, and profitability. 

## Key aspects of financial linkage:

### Data Integration

The initial phase involves collecting and synthesizing information from multiple sources, including customer reviews, sales data, marketing initiatives, and financial reports.

### Relationship Identifiaction

Financial Linkage analysis seeks to identify the relationships among various data points. For instance, it can show how customer satisfaction ratings relate to sales numbers or how expenditures on marketing campaigns influence customer lifetime value.

### Pattern Recognition

Through the analysis of interconnected data, companies can uncover patterns and trends that might not be visible when examining isolated data sets.

### Desicion/Actionable Recommendations

The knowledge acquired from linkage analysis can inform better choices regarding product development, pricing approaches, customer retention, and other aspects.
